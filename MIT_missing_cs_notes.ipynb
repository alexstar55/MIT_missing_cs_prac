When you run commands in your shell, you are really writing a small bit of code that your shell interprets. If the shell is asked to execute a command that doesn’t match one of its programming keywords, it consults an environment variable called $PATH that lists which directories the shell should search for programs when it is given a command:"

    "In this lecture we will go through several ways in which you can improve your workflow when using the shell. We have been working with the shell for a while now, but we have mainly focused on executing different commands. We will now see how to run several processes at the same time while keeping track of them, how to stop or pause a specific process and how to make a process run in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also learn about different ways to improve your shell and other tools, by defining aliases and configuring them using dotfiles. Both of these can help you save time, e.g. by using the same configurations in all your machines without having to type long commands. We will look at how to work with remote machines using SSH.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Job Control  \n",
    "In some cases you will need to interrupt a job while it is executing, for instance if a command is taking too long to complete (such as a find with a very large directory structure to search through). Most of the time, you can do Ctrl-C and the command will stop. But how does this actually work and why does it sometimes fail to stop the process?   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Killing a process  \n",
    "Your shell is using a UNIX communication mechanism called a signal to communicate information to the process. When a process receives a signal it stops its execution, deals with the signal and potentially changes the flow of execution based on the information that the signal delivered. For this reason, signals are software interrupts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, when typing Ctrl-C this prompts the shell to deliver a SIGINT signal to the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a minimal example of a Python program that captures SIGINT and ignores it, no longer stopping. To kill this program we can now use the SIGQUIT signal instead, by typing Ctrl-\\\\.  \n",
    "```\n",
    "#!/usr/bin/env python\n",
    "import signal, time\n",
    "\n",
    "def handler(signum, time):\n",
    "    print(\"\\nI got a SIGINT, but I am not stopping\")\n",
    "\n",
    "signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, handler)\n",
    "i = 0\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    time.sleep(.1)\n",
    "    print(\"\\r{}\".format(i), end=\"\")\n",
    "    i += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here’s what happens if we send SIGINT twice to this program, followed by SIGQUIT. Note that ^ is how Ctrl is displayed when typed in the terminal.\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ python sigint.py\n",
    "24^C\n",
    "I got a SIGINT, but I am not stopping\n",

    "30^\\[1]    39913 quit       python sigint.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While SIGINT and SIGQUIT are both usually associated with terminal related requests, a more generic signal for asking a process to exit gracefully is the SIGTERM signal. To send this signal we can use the kill command, with the syntax kill -TERM <PID>.  "

    "#### Pausing and backgrounding processes    \n",
    "Signals can do other things beyond killing a process. For instance, **SIGSTOP** pauses a process. In the terminal, typing Ctrl-Z will prompt the shell to send a **SIGTSTP** signal, short for Terminal Stop (i.e. the terminal’s version of **SIGSTOP**).  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can then continue the paused job in the foreground or in the background using fg or bg, respectively.  \n",
    "The jobs command lists the unfinished jobs associated with the current terminal session. You can refer to those jobs using their pid (you can use pgrep to find that out). More intuitively, you can also refer to a process using the percent symbol followed by its job number (displayed by jobs). To refer to the last backgrounded job you can use the $! special parameter.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One more thing to know is that the & suffix in a command will run the command in the background, giving you the prompt back, although it will still use the shell’s **STDOUT** which can be annoying (use shell redirections in that case).  \n",
    "\n",
    "To background an already running program you can do Ctrl-Z followed by bg. Note that backgrounded processes are still children processes of your terminal and will die if you close the terminal (this will send yet another signal, SIGHUP). To prevent that from happening you can run the program with nohup (a wrapper to ignore SIGHUP), or use disown if the process has already been started. Alternatively, you can use a terminal multiplexer as we will see in the next section.\n",
